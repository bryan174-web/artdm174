<p>The name "lion" has its origin in different languages, for example the Latin word leo and the ancient greek word leon. Linneaus, a Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist known mostly as the father of modern taxonomy, once referred to the lion as a part of the species Felis leo in his work, Systema Naturae during the 18th century.</p>
<p>The lion is nowadays part of the Panthera species, called Panthera leo, along with four other big cats; the tiger (Panthera tigris), the jaguar (Panthera ocra) and the leopard (Panthera pardus). The name Panthera leo is believed to derive from Greek pan-(all) and ther (beast) but this isn't necessarily true. It also shows a striking resemblance to the Sanskrit word pundarikam (tiger) which in turn may originate from pandarah which means "whitish-yellow".</p>
