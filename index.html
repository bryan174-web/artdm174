<h3>My career goals</h3>
<p>I would like to find a job as a graphic designer, or a job similar to graphic design like a 3D animator or a job in motion graphics.
    I'm oursueng this career because I love working with digital art media.  I currently hold an AA degree in Graphic Design.  I'm thinking of taking 
    Digital Interface Design next semester.  I'm intrested in UX/UI.

    <h2>What I know about web design so far</h2>
    <p>I've learned how to aquire and configure a web hosting account. I have learned  HTML, and file organization.  I've learned to 
        create a mini website with various types of links, images and applying CSS styles for the world wide web.
        Its the third week in of Artdm-174 web design and I've learned about transitions and animation,
        JavaScritpt basics starting with Git and Github.
    </p>
        <h3>New things I hope to learn</h3>
<p> I would like to learn to acquire videos on a website.  Where do web designers apply for work?
      How much do web designers make? In Web Design with JavaScipt I'm new to  JavaScript, Git, and
    GitHub, I've never knew that its existed.  I may have heard of it in my web design one class but 
not much.  I hope to learn more about JavaScript and Github. I wonder what else they can do.
